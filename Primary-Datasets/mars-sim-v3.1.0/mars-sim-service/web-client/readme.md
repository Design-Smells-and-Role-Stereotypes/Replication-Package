# Mars Sim React client
Clone the repo, run:
Install node js first on development machine

Then load dependencies for this client
    npm install

Run:

    npm run build

 This will copy the compiled app.js into the public directory to be hosted by the Spring Boot app.

The Bootstrap custom theme is created using Lavish (http://lavishbootstrap.com)  using the main Mars Sim project image.
