UnitManager
-----------
Appears to methods that should sit inside the Settlement class, i.e. elect*


Unit
----
There appears to be methods that related to specific subtypes.

A lot of instanceof use


RobotAttributes & PersonAttributes
----------------------------------
Could these be combined to a single Enum and hence a single AttributeManager.
This base class would have a list of applicable Attributes to be managed. Would be subclassed for Person & Robot.


Vehicle, Robot & Person (& Equipment ?)
-----------------------
A lot of duplicate code concerning logins for inside or outside
Would make sense to have a another subclass of MovableUnit & StaticUnit


PersonTaskmanager RobotTaskManger
---------------------------------
These two seem very similar. Could they be combined


MissionManager
-------
A lot of use instanceOf


Simulation
----------
Sponsor would be better as a Enum
Country also should be an Enum with a sub-property for Planet, i.e. Mars or Earth. Too much string manipulation
